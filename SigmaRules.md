# Sigma Rules

**Sigma rules** are used in cybersecurity, specifically in **threat detection** and **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** systems.

Provides a standardized way to describe log-based detection rules, similar to how **Snort** or **YARA** rules work but for log data.

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is Sigma?

- Sigma is an **open standard** for writing rules that **detect suspicious or malicious activity** in **log files**.
- The goal is to make these rules **platform-agnostic**, so a single Sigma rule can be converted to work with many different SIEM tools like **Splunk**, **Elastic (ELK)**, **Graylog**, **Microsoft Sentinel**, etc.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Structure of a Sigma Rule

A typical Sigma rule is written in **YAML** and includes:

1. **Metadata**: title, id, author, description, etc.
2. **Log source**: type of logs (e.g., Windows Security, Sysmon, etc.)
3. **Detection logic**: conditions to match (e.g., process name, command line, file path).
4. **Level/severity**: informational, low, medium, high, critical.
5. **Tags**: MITRE ATT&CK techniques, tactics, etc.

## ðŸ”¹ Example Sigma Rule

```yaml
title: Suspicious PowerShell Download
id: 1234-5678-9012
description: Detects PowerShell commands downloading files from the internet
author: YourName
date: 2025/08/05
logsource:
  category: process_creation
  product: windows
detection:
  selection:
    Image|endswith: powershell.exe
    CommandLine|contains: "Invoke-WebRequest"
  condition: selection
level: high
tags:
  - attack.execution
  - attack.t1059.001

```
